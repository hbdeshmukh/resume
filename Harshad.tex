\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
\item{\textbf{Adaptive Concurrent Query Scheduler For Quickstep Database System} (Under submission)}\\
		\textendash\ Developed an adaptive, and responsive database scheduler for concurrent queries.\\
		\textendash\ The scheduler separates resource sharing policies from mechanisms using a probabilistic framework. \\
		\textendash\ Demonstrated the effectiveness of policies such as fair, highest priority first and proportional priority.\\
		\textendash\ \textbf{Contributions:} 1\textsuperscript{st} author, formulation of ideas with Prof. Patel and implementation of the scheduler.\\
\item{\textbf{Quickstep: A High Performance Data Platform based
on a Scaling-In Approach} (Under submission)}	\\
		\textendash\ Described the Quickstep database system developed with a scaling-in design philosophy.\\
		\textendash\ Showcased the adaptive nature of the query scheduler by flexibly changing CPU resources while the query is in progress. \\
		\textendash\ Demonstration of a query progress monitor highlighting live statistics including degree of parallelism of relational operators, execution times etc.\\
		\textendash\ \textbf{Contributions:} Co-author with Quickstep colleagues, Design and performing experiments, profiling query execution, and optimizing query execution performance.
